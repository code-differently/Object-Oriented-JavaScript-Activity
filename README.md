# Object Oriented JavaScript Activity

## Part 1
Create an object literal to represent a Facebook post. Include any `properties` or `functions` you think you might need. Try accessing and updating the contents with both `bracket notation` and `dot notation`. See and example below:
```javascript
let post = {
    name: "Kaleb Burd",
    message: "@coderhino why is your code hot garbage?"
}

post.message = "@coderhino writes code like it's a work of fine art"
```

## Part 2
Create a class that models a Tweet. The class should allow the user to add and remove a letter as well as view the current message. The message should never be allowed to be longer than 140 characters :thinking:
